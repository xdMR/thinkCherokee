                    <p>I was raised in a traditional Cherokee home. For me, being traditional is a way of life I was
                        raised with my language and the Cherokee language as with all other languages offer its speakers
                        alternative ideas and other possible views of how one sees the world. I grew up with family
                        members who were traditional healers who understood the importance of our teachings and how it
                        allows us to see that we are a part of this world and not the masters of it. They taught me that
                        being humble, thankful and joyful no matter how little we had was empowering. I have always had
                        tremendous respect for our Elders who retained and nurtured the true Cherokee way of life and I
                        am so thankful that I listened to their stories and teachings.<span id="dots">...</span> <span
                            id="more">
                            From the age of 14, I was spending my time visiting Elders and recording old terms and words
                            that were no longer being used in order to save that knowledge. It was just twenty years
                            later that I myself started to find it difficult to speak with someone in Cherokee due to
                            the lack of speakers. I have spent my entire life believing in a single goal--that I have to
                            find a way to make learning Cherokee more understandable and easier for you! Studying old
                            forms of written Cherokee and comparing our ancestors ability to use the language with
                            today's form of speech made it possible. I noticed that traditional people still spoke the
                            old way, even today and that the difference in speech was caused by loss of Cherokee thought
                            and belief in the old practices. It was then very clear to me that our traditional way of
                            life was far more endangered than our language. Therefore, I developed a teaching method
                            that would allow students to acquire Cherokee thought. By explaining traditional practices
                            and customs, and how they shape the beliefs behind the meaning of the words, my students
                            were able to see the world from a Cherokee perspective which gave them valuable insight with
                            regards to how we speak Cherokee.

                    <p>I have heard from many people who feel the same as you! Many people weren't raised
                        in a traditional Cherokee home or they would like to understand the Cherokee worldview.
                        Without access to Cherokee culture, it is impossible to gain a first-hand understanding of what
                        it means to 'Think Cherokee'!
                        Not all programs, textbooks, or websites are able to answer your specific questions or
                        you just can't reach someone when you really need guidance about a topic you are reading.
                        Without that much needed guidance, your frustration can start to discourage you and even
                        destroy your enthusiasm to learn. Today, Indigenous peoples world-wide are facing extinction!
                        We are losing our languages, spiritual views, cultures, and our values. When facing such a
                        threat, we cannot afford for YOU to not have adequate resources!
                        Imagine being one of two remaining English speakers. The problem is you live on
                        one side of the world and the remaining speaker lives on the other. With no means to
                        communicate, you both are lonely and starving for social interaction with each other.
                        Think Cherokee programs are designed to be the bridge between the two speakers. By
                        providing the bridge that will allow open communication, YOU can have first-hand instruction
                        designed to make your learning experience authentic and sincere--WITHOUT the frustration!

                    <p>How do the programs work? By teaching you to Think Cherokee, you will learn the spiritual,
                        and socio-linguistic aspects that are required to inherit an intimate understanding of our
                        language. Traditional practices, customs, beliefs, and spirituality are deeply embedded in
                        Cherokee expression and those teachings are necessary for a clear understanding of how to
                        articulate the language in a pure and authentic way.

                        With benefits of the socio-linguistic approach, you not only gain a profound understanding of
                        Cherokee traditional world-view but you also gain...

                        Authentic, Traditional Cherokee Instruction
                        All programs and sessions gain you access to one-on-one instruction with a traditional
                        Cherokee speaker.

                        Personalized Sessions
                        If you have studied independently and a full course doesn't fit your needs--personalized
                        sessions are for you! Individual one-hour sessions allow you to refine your study by utilizing
                        your time with the instructor and get the answers you need.
