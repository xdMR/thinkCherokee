                    <p>I was raised in a traditional Cherokee home.  I grew up with family members who were traditional healers who understood the importance of our teachings and how it allows us to see that we are a part of this world and not the masters of it. They taught me that being humble, thankful and joyful no matter how little we had was empowering. From the age of 14, I was spending my time visiting Elders and recording old terms and words that were no longer being used in order to save that knowledge.</p>

                            <p>I have spent my entire life believing in a single goal--that I have to find a way to make learning Cherokee more understandable and easier for you! Therefore, I developed a teaching method that would allow students to acquire Cherokee thought. By explaining traditional practices and customs, and how they shape the beliefs behind the meaning of the words, you will be able to see the world from a Cherokee perspective which gives you valuable insight with regards to how we speak Cherokee.

                   <p> I have heard from many people who feel the same as you! Many people weren't raised in a traditional Cherokee home or they would like to understand the Cherokee worldview. Without access to Cherokee culture, it is impossible to gain a first-hand understanding of what it means to 'Think Cherokee'! </p>

                   <p> Not all programs, textbooks, or websites are able to answer your specific questions or you just can't reach someone when you really need guidance about a topic you are reading. Without that much needed guidance, your frustration can start to discourage you and even destroy your enthusiasm to learn. </p>

                 <p>   Today, Indigenous peoples world-wide are facing extinction! We are losing our languages, spiritual views, cultures, and our values. When facing such a threat, we cannot afford for YOU to not have adequate resources! Imagine being one of two remaining English speakers. The problem is you live on one side of the world and the remaining speaker lives on the other. With no means to communicate, you both are lonely and starving for social interaction with each other. </p>

                  <p>  Think Cherokee programs are designed to be the bridge between the two speakers. By providing the bridge that will allow open communication, YOU can have first-hand instruction designed to make your learning experience authentic and sincere--WITHOUT the frustration!</p>

                    <p>How do the programs work? By teaching you to Think Cherokee, you will learn the spiritual, and socio-linguistic aspects that are required to inherit an intimate understanding of our language. Traditional practices, customs, beliefs, and spirituality are deeply embedded in Cherokee expression and those teachings are necessary for a clear understanding of how to articulate the language in a pure and authentic way. </p>

                      <p>  With benefits of the socio-linguistic approach, you not only gain a profound understanding of Cherokee traditional world-views but you also gain...
                        Authentic, Traditional Cherokee Instruction All programs and sessions gain you access to one-on-one instruction with a traditional Cherokee speaker.  </p>

                     <p>   If you have studied independently and a full course doesn't fit your needs--personalized sessions are for you! Individual one-hour sessions allow you to refine your study by utilizing your time with the instructor and get the answers you need.</p>
